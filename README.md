# hey there ðŸ‘‹
i'm matt - an infra eng from new york
- i love metrics and o11y
- i'm convinced bare metal kube is going to be the next big thing - it allows you to iterate quickly + is pretty cheap to operate
  - beyond kube, i think self hosted options are generally becoming very competitive to the cloud
- leading infra efforts at [zora](https://x.com/zora) to scale for our next million users
- alice in chains unplugged is arguably one of the best live performances of all time

ðŸ“« you can find me on [x](https://x.com/mjmalec41) or on discord if you know where to look :)
