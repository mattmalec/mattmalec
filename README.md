# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt, a Java, Go, and Python developer from New York with a love for blockchain & system architecture.
- I love metrics and observability. I'm a fan of building dashboards and creating alerts that answer "why" with little to no thought.
- Using [Pterodactyl](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/) as a really simple way to run Docker containers.
- Currently building production-grade Kubernetes clusters on bare metal cloud providers and on-prem â€” designing systems that run more affordably, yet more performant than the cloud.
- Working with [Zora](https://twitter.com/ourZORA) to build the most advanced and capable indexer on the blockchain.
