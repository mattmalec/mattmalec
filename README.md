# Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Matt, a Java and Go developer from New York with a love for blockchain & system architecture.
- I love the AWS suite and use everything from EC2 to API Gateway
- Using [Pterodactyl](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/) as a really simple way to run Docker containers.
- Currently learning Kubernetes. I spend most of my free time working with Docker. Scalable systems and load balancing is awesome
- Working with [Zora](https://twitter.com/ourZORA) to build the most advanced and capable indexer on the blockchain

ðŸ“« You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mjmalec41) or on Discord if you know where to look :)
