# hey there ðŸ‘‹
i'm matt - an infra eng from new york
- i love metrics and o11y
- i'm very excited seeing the adoption rate of bare metal kube increase - it allows you to iterate quickly + is pretty cheap to operate
  - beyond kube, i think self hosted options are generally becoming very competitive to the cloud
- building infra at [fal](https://fal.ai) to scale to our next million users. previously led infra efforts at [zora](https://x.com/)
- alice in chains unplugged is arguably one of the best live performances of all time
